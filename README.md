====

RNA-Sequencing data differential expression analysis pipeline. 
Performs: genome coverage (via bedtools and HTSeq), generates Circos code and plots, differential expression (via DESeq and NOISeq), structural variant detection (e.g. fusion genes, via SVDetect) and differential exon usage (via DEXSeq).

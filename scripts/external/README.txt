These files were NOT created by me, Olga Botvinnik. I have included them
to make it easier for you to prepare DEXSeq annotations.

The DEXSeq files were created by Simon Anders <sanders at fs.tum.de> and Alejandro Reyes <areyes at lcg.unam.mx>, both at EMBL Heidelberg. The files can be found on: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html

tr: when not truncating set1, string2 must be non-empty

Usage:   samtools merge [-nr] [-h inh.sam] <out.bam> <in1.bam> <in2.bam> [...]

Options: -n       sort by read names
         -r       attach RG tag (inferred from file names)
         -u       uncompressed BAM output
         -f       overwrite the output BAM if exist
         -1       compress level 1
         -R STR   merge file in the specified region STR [all]
         -h FILE  copy the header in FILE to <out.bam> [in1.bam]

Note: Samtools' merge does not reconstruct the @RG dictionary in the header. Users
      must provide the correct header with -h, or uses Picard which properly maintains
      the header dictionary in merging.
